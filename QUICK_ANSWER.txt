QUICK REFERENCE: IS IT REAL OR MOCK?
================================================================================

YES, THIS APP GENERATES REAL OUTPUT
────────────────────────────────────

When you upload an invoice and click "Analyze":
✓ Moonshot AI (kimi-k2.5) ACTUALLY extracts:
  - Vendor name
  - Invoice number
  - Dates, amounts, details
  - Performs policy checks
  - Calculates risk scores
  - Returns real JSON data

When you compare policies:
✓ Moonshot AI ACTUALLY analyzes:
  - Company policy vs benchmark
  - Identifies gaps
  - Recommends changes
  - Returns detailed comparison

When you ask questions about documents:
✓ Moonshot AI ACTUALLY:
  - Searches document content
  - Finds relevant passages
  - Generates answers in real-time
  - Streams responses to your browser


WHY YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S MOCK
───────────────────────────────

1. Document Processing Workers
   - Background jobs queue created ✓
   - But workers NOT auto-started ⚠️
   - Need to manually run Python scripts
   - Until then, documents stay in "processing"

2. Missing Features
   - Adverse media screening: Queued but not processed
   - API keys: UI only, no backend
   - Webhooks: Schema but no implementation

3. First-Time Setup
   - Needs MOONSHOT_API_KEY environment variable
   - Needs LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY for PDF processing
   - Needs PostgreSQL + Redis running
   - Needs auth configured


CORE FEATURES ARE NOT MOCK
────────────────────────────────

✓ Invoice Analysis    → 100% Real (Moonshot API calls)
✓ Policy Comparison   → 100% Real (Moonshot API calls)
✓ Document Q&A        → 100% Real (Moonshot API calls)
✓ Advanced Search     → 100% Real (Moonshot API calls)
✓ Risk Detection      → Real with caching (Moonshot AI)
✓ Admin Stats         → Real (Database queries)

These generate actual outputs, not placeholders!


OPTIONAL FEATURES THAT AREN'T DONE
────────────────────────────────────

✗ Adverse Media Scanning (not implemented)
✗ API Key Management (UI only)
✗ Webhooks (schema only)
✗ Automated Worker Processing (disabled by default)


DEPENDENCIES
─────────────

For FULL functionality, you need:

1. Environment Variables (.env)
   MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_key_here
   LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   REDIS_URL=redis://...

2. Running Services
   - PostgreSQL (can use Docker)
   - Redis (can use Docker)
   - Node.js app (npm run dev)

3. Optional for full pipeline
   - Python worker: python workers/document_processor.py
   - Python pipeline: python workers/pipeline_runner.py


BOTTOM LINE
────────────

This is NOT a mock application!

Core invoice, policy, and search features ARE calling real AI.
They WILL generate real outputs when properly configured.

What IS missing:
- Automated background processing (workers need manual start)
- Advanced screening features (adverse media not built)
- Some UI features without backend (API keys, webhooks)

Start with invoice/policy comparison/Q&A → these work immediately
Then set up workers for document processing pipeline
